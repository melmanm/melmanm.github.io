In this article i will describe how to create custom Winforms window, which can be resized, dragged, and snapped, providing the same experience as standard Windows window.

What motivates developer to create custom Winforms window is, in most cases, an application window design. Standard windows window is configurable to some extend, however not all features are supported or easy to implement. For instance, in my recent project I designed a window with title bar and navigation buttons placed inside the kind of centered "notch".

I decided to create this article, since I didn't find any comprehensive material covering the topic.

## Removing window tittle bar and borders
In order to design custom window we need get rid of default windows tittle bar and border. It can be done by setting Form's `FormBorderStyle` property.

```csharp
FormBorderStyle = FormBorderStyle.None;
```
`FormBorderStyle.None` hides the widow tittle bar and borders. Afterwards, custom tittle bar and border can be implemented and styled inside the window client area using Winforms controls.

Unfortunately, once `FormBorderStyle.None` is set, window loses resizing, dragging and snapping functionalities.

Let's add it back!

## Window dragging
Window dragging can be normally achieved by pressing left mouse button a on a window tittle bar, and moving the window around, as long as the button is pressed.

Default window tittle bar was removed by setting `FormBorderStyle` property. Now, let's create a custom tittle bar, by placing a `Panel` control at top of the `Form`.

![custom-tittle-bar](/assets/img/article13/custom-tittle-bar.png)

In order to detect when user left mouse button is pressed in the panel area, and start dragging the window, panel's `MouseDown` event needs to be handled

```csharp
const uint WM_NCLBUTTONDOWN = 0xA1;
const uint HT_CAPTION = 0x2;

private void menuPanel_MouseDown(object sender, MouseEventArgs e)
{
    if (e.Button == MouseButtons.Left)
    {
        PInvoke.ReleaseCapture();
        PInvoke.SendMessage(new HWND(Handle), WM_NCLBUTTONDOWN, new WPARAM(HT_CAPTION), new LPARAM());
    }
}
```

Above implementation requires a comment. `ReleaseCapture` and `SendMessage` functions are implemented in Windows native `user32.dll`. In order to invoke `user32.dll` methods in C# code, marshalling is needed. 

You can use `DllImport` attribute to specify these functions signatures, or, as I did, make use of the [Microsoft.Windows.CsWin32 nuget package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Windows.CsWin32/), which does the marshalling for you.

### ReleaseCapture
Normally the the mouse is captured by the control, after user presses mouse button over it, and released after uses releases the button. `ReleaseCapture` function does not wait for mouse up event, but releases the capture instantly. It is a preparation for the next step.

### SendMessage
`SendMessage` function with `WM_NCLBUTTONDOWN` and `HT_CAPTION` arguments, is used to inform the system that mouse button was pressed over the original window title bar. Thanks to this trick, windows starts dragging action. Since the mouse button is already pressed, dragging continues as usual, until it is released by the user.

## Window Resizing
After applying `FormBorderStyle.None` style, window lost borders and the ability to use them to for resizing.

In order to bring back resizing functionality, we will try to capture `WM_NCHITTEST` message.`WM_NCHITTEST` message is sent by the system to Winforms form, whenever cursor moves or mouse button is clicked. System sends this message to the Winforms form, expecting window to respond. Winforms form response contains an information about the window element which is currently pointed by the cursor.

The plan for implementation is quite simple. Fist `WM_NCHITTEST` message needs to be captured. To do so, we override the `WndProc` method in the code-behind. Next, we check if cursor is pointing at the specific widow edge (left, right, top, bottom or corner). If that is a case, we generate the response, containing corresponding window border identifier. Thanks to this trick, windows start to behave like the original window border (which is hidden by `FormBorderStyle.None`) is clicked on hovered.

Following code-behind shows how to implement resizing feature for the right window edge.

```csharp
const int WM_NCHITTEST = 0x0084;
const int HTRIGHT = 11;
const int BorderSize = 4;
protected override void WndProc(ref Message m)
{
    if (m.Msg == WM_NCHITTEST)
    {
        base.WndProc(ref m);

        //cursor position
        var cursorPosition = PointToClient(Cursor.Position);
        //border area
        Rectangle rightBorderRectangle  = new Rectangle(ClientSize.Width - BorderSize, 0, BorderSize, ClientSize.Height);

        if (rightBorderRectangle.Contains(cursorPosition))
            m.Result = (IntPtr)HTRIGHT;
    }
}
```

> Implementation can be extended for other edges and corners, by using corresponding return values defined at https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/inputdev/wm-nchittest

> Note that `BorderSize` can be adjusted to your needs. It defines the width of the area, which will be considered as window border, given in px.

## Window snapping to edges of the screen

After applying `FormBorderStyle.None` style, window lost the ability to snap to screen edges.

In order bring this functionality back, the window style needs be adjusted, to get the original border back.

Forms's `CreateParams` getter needs to be overrode, to properly style the  window. `WS_SIZEBOX` style applies back window sizing border .

```csharp
const int WS_SIZEBOX = 0x40000;
protected override CreateParams CreateParams
{
    get
    {
        var @params = base.CreateParams;
        @params.Style |= WS_SIZEBOX;
        return @params;
    }
}
```
> More about window styles can be found at https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/winmsg/window-styles

Next, by handling specific windows messages, we can prevent from drawing the original border.

**The main goal of this trick is to utilize snapping functionality, which is implemented by the original window sizing boarder, but prevent from displaying the original border.**

Let's take a look at the code-behind implementation

```csharp
const int WM_NCCALCSIZE = 0x0083;
const int WM_NCACTIVATE = 0x0086;
protected override void WndProc(ref Message m)
{
    if (m.Msg == WM_NCCALCSIZE)
        return; 

    if (m.Msg == WM_NCACTIVATE)
        m.LParam = new IntPtr(-1);

    base.WndProc(ref m)
}
```


By handling `WM_NCCALCSIZE` and `WM_NCACTIVATE` messages, we can prevent from drawing the window sizing border.

* `WM_NCCALCSIZE` message is sent by the system, to notify the Winforms form, that window size or position has changed. By default in Winforms application, `WM_NCCALCSIZE` message is handled by `PresentationFramework`. Default handler implementation checks, if widow style assumes any borders. If that is a case, window size is increased, in each direction by the value of border size, to ensure window is large enough display both client area and window border. In proposed implementation this behavior is bypassed.
* `WM_NCACTIVATE` message is sent by the system, to notify the Winforms form, that window has been activated or deactivated. (For instance when window lost or gets focus.) To reflect new window state, default `WM_NCACTIVATE` message handler tries to repaint the window tittle bar. It needs to be prevented. As per [documetation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/winmsg/wm-ncactivate). _If this [lParam] parameter is set to -1, DefWindowProc does not repaint the nonclient area to reflect the state change._

Now the snapping functionality is in place.
