## Introduction
In [previous article](/2023-01-30-article3-openid-connect-session-management.md) I described session management possibilities provided by OpenId Connect.  

OpenId Connect session is a way to maintain the context of logged in user across Applications, running on user device, and Identity Provider Server. Vast majority of modern web application works in the context of logged-in user. OAuth-based solutions delegates identity management to external Identity Provider Server. From application perspective it is important to be synchronized with Identity Provider and be able to react on user session events. It becomes even more relevant if multiple applications operate in the context of the same user session (SSO solutions).  

In this article I will describe Azure AD B2C-specific approach to session management in SSO environment. As the article goal is to inspect session management from developer perspective, I will refer to the code samples. Code samples originate from to React.js SPA application, supported by MSAL.js library.

## MSAL
MSAL (Microsoft Authentication Library) is an open-source library, which enables developers to utilize OAuth 2.0 based services like Azure AD or Azure AD B2C. MSAL provides a set of functions designed to run specific OAuth 2.0 flows and acquire tokens. MSAL helps with application user management, by supporting login, logout, edit profile or change password user flows. MASL provides user context to the application using browser storage. It enables applications to maintain their own user-related cookies layer. 

MSAL is available on many platforms (MSAL.js, MSAL for Java, MSAL.NET and more) 

## SSO- Single sign-on and Single sign-out 
Single sign-in and single sign-out functionalities are important in the context of user session management. It allows to synchronize user session status across many applications launched in the context of the same browser. SSO improves user experience by bypassing frequent re-authentications. 

### Single sign-on
Azure AD B2C single sign-on (SSO) mechanism allows the same user session to be used by multiple applications. It provides great user experience, since user can use many applications registered in Azure AD B2C, after single sign on to one of them. It is possible, thanks to user session cookie, which is stored in user browser after successful login. Session cookie is then sent to Azure AD B2C with subsequent requests, where can be recognized and validated. Once it is valid, Azure AD B2C assumes user session is active. In result login form is not displayed again.

### SSO scope
Azure AD B2C allows to configure applications that are allowed to share the same user session. More information on how to configure Azure AD B2C can be found in [Microsoft docs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory-b2c/session-behavior?pivots=b2c-custom-policy#configure-azure-ad-b2c-session-behavior). 

### Single sign-out
Single sign-out mechanism ensures that after user logs out from single application, other applications in SSO scope, which use the same user session, are notified. In response to notification, applications can drop the context of current user and redirect to login page, indicating current user is logged out and authentication is required. 

## Azure AD B2C supported session management methods 
Table below shows which OpenId Session management solutions, described in [previous article](/_posts/2023-01-30-article3-openid-connect-session-management.md), are supported by Azure AD B2C: 


| Solution Type | Solution                          | Azure AD B2C support  |
| :---          | :----                             |:----|
| polling based | check_session_iframe endpoint     | No  |
| polling based | /authorize endpoint polling       | Yes |
| Logout based  | Front-channel logout              | Yes |
| Logout based  | Back-channel logout               | No  |

## /authorize endpoint polling
In order to determine user session status, application can cyclically call Azure AD B2C */authorize* endpoint. */authorize* endpoint is used to initialize OAuth flow. In the context authentication it is called with *openid* scope. Flow results in *id_token* passed to the application. 

*Note that MSAL.js always initializes PKCE grant flow to obtain id_token.* 

Once user authenticates with Azure AD B2C, session cookie is created in user’s browser. Azure AD B2C creates ***x-ms-cpim-sso:{tenantId}*** cookie with the value of user’s session id. Cookie is encrypted and can be interpreted solely by Azure AD B2C.

If Azure AD B2C user session cookie exists in user’s browser, it is automatically attached to every http call to its origin, including subsequent */authorize* endpoint calls. In case attached session cookie is valid (not expired, not malformed, not revoked) PKCE flow is completed, without user being asked to enter credentials.  

*Note that each flow results in fresh id_token to passed to the application. Since id_token is obtained in each flow application is always updated with latest user data (Even if some user profile is edited in the meantime by different application).*

To take advantage from */authorize* endpoint pooling, *prompt=none* parameter should be included in */authorize* request. Otherwise, login form will always be displayed, regardless the active session. 

Following diagram present initial authentication flow. During initial authentication user is asked to enter credentials and session cookie is settled in the browser.

Subsequent authentication flow can be initiated by application in */authorize* endpoint polling scenario (diagram below is based on assumption, there is a valid session cookie available in the browser storage)

### User Experience 
The common practice to improve user experience, is to embed */authorize* request in the iframe. Instead of redirecting the user to IdP site and back, iframe gives a feeling of a background call, which doesn’t interrupt user interaction with application. MSAL.js provides ***ssoSilent*** function to acquire *id_token* using iframe. 

Below there is a fragment of MSAL.js core implementation related with *ssoSilent* function 

```js
async ssoSilent(request: SsoSilentRequest): Promise<AuthenticationResult> { 
  const correlationId = this.getRequestCorrelationId(request); 
      //... 
      const silentIframeClient = this.createSilentIframeClient(validRequest.correlationId); 
      result = silentIframeClient.acquireToken(validRequest); 
      //... 
} 
```

*There is alternative way to silently call authorize endpoint is to use WAM (Web Assembly Manager) widely described in [MSAL.js docs](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-js/blob/dev/lib/msal-browser/docs/device-bound-tokens.md). At the time this article is created WAM, is supported by Azure AD, but there is not support for Azure AD B2C*. 

### React to session expiration
So far, we focused on happy path, assuming there is a valid user session cookie available in the browser. Once there is no active user session provided to Azure AD B2C, *ssoSilent* function call fails. 

In case session cookie is missing, expired or not valid, Azure AD B2C displays login form. In order to prevent clickjacking attack, Azure AD B2C doesn’t allow to display login form in iframe. It is indicated by X-Frame-Options: DENY http header, added by Azure AD B2C to login page. Clickjacking is very well described in [OWASP](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Clickjacking) and [Auth0](https://auth0.com/blog/preventing-clickjacking-attacks/) articles.

Attempt to display login form in iframe using *ssoSilent* method ends with: 
```
InteractionRequiredAuthError: interaction_required: AADB2C90077: 
User does not have an existing session and request prompt parameter has a value of 'None'. 
```
This exception is however very useful and can be used as an indication of user session expiration. Exception handling block can redirect user to custom logout page or force to reauthenticate by redirecting to */authorize* endpoint (without iframe). Following example shows how to logout user from application when session no longer valid:

```js
const callSsoSilent = async () => { 
    try { 
        await instance.ssoSilent(silentRequest); 
 
 
    } catch (e) { 
        if (e instanceof InteractionRequiredAuthError) { 
            instance.logoutRedirect({ 
                account: instance.getActiveAccount(), 
                //prevents from notifying a server about logout, logout is performed only locally - in applicaiton scpoe 
                onRedirectNavigate: false 
            }); 
        } 
        else{ 
            //handling of other error 
        } 
    } 
} 
```
### Third party cookies
*/autorize* endpoint polling solution is dependent on third-party cookie access. Azure AD B2C is requested in iframe from application domain needs to access session cookies. In this context, they are considered as third party cookies. 

For security reasons some browsers implement strict policies related with third-party cookies access. To ensure access to session cookie is possible, Azure AD B2C tenant can be available in the same domain as application. For example https://login.example.com while app is hosted on https://example.com. Now, session cookie is not considered as third party since it originates from the same domain. It can be achieved using [Azure Front Door](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory-b2c/custom-domain?pivots=b2c-custom-policy). 

### Azure AD B2C API rate limits
It is important to consiter increased network traffic and possible latency in polling implementation. Every polling-based strategy should consider API rate limits, to ensure they are not exceeded. Azure AD B2C limits requests in contexts of tenant and IP.

|Measure | Limit |
|:--- | :---|
|Maximum requests per IP per Azure AD B2C tenant | 6,000/5min |
| Maximum requests per Azure AD B2C tenant | 200/sec |

In next article I will focuse on **front-channel logout**.
