This article shows how to enable blazor web assembly application, to obtain the authorization to access web API with Azure AD B2C.

![access-web-api](/assets/img/article14/access-web-api.png)

> Authorization process presented in this article is based on OAuth framework. Basic understanding of OAuth should be considered as prerequisite for reading this article. If you are not familiar with OAuth concepts, read [my previous article](https://melmanm.github.io/misc/2023/07/30/article9-oauth-20-the-basiscs-of-modern-authorization.html).

In scope of this article we will:

* create and set up blazor WASM and Web API applications
* configure app registrations in Azure AD B2C. (Both blazor application and web API application needs to be represented in Azure AD B2C by app registration)

## Setting up blazor WASM

### Creating Azure AD B2C app registration

Let's start with creating Azure AD B2C app registration for blazor WASM application, follow the process described in:
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory-b2c/tutorial-register-applications#app-registrations

### Setting up demo application

The command below creates blazor WASM application project, pre-configured with Azure AD B2C as the authorization server (and as the identity provider). 

> Before executing the command fill the placeholders with your tenant and application data.

```
dotnet new blazorwasm --auth IndividualB2C --aad-b2c-instance AAD-B2C-INSTANCE --domain DOMAIN --susi-policy-id SUSI-POLICY --client-id CLIENT-ID --name blazorWASM-application
```

|Command placeholder|Description|
|--- |--- |
|`AAD-B2C-INSTANCE`| Url to the Azure B2C instance - https://TENANT_NAME.b2clogin.com/ |
|`DOMAIN`| Domain name can be found in Azure Portal in Azure AD B2C **Overview** blade|
|`SUSI-POLICY`|Name of the user flow used to log in/out users. Flow can be created in Azure AD B2C **User Flows** Blade. See [user flows documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory-b2c/tutorial-create-user-flows) for reference.
|`CLIENT-ID`| Client id of blazor app registration can be found in corresponding app registration's **Overview** blade|

By default, created project is running on localhost's random port. Check the port number in `launchSettings.json` file created under /Properties directory, add `https://localhost:PORT/authentication/login-callback` redirect uri to in blazor app registration's **Authentication** blade.

### Testing the application

Now let's run the application and try to log in.
![log-in](/assets/img/article14/log-in.png)

In the process of logging in, Azure AD B2C issues an id token, which includes user-related data, for blazor application.

## Setting up WebAPI

### Creating Azure AD B2C app registration

The process of creating Azure AD B2C app registration for web API application is well described in microsoft documentation. Follow the first paragraph of [Add a web API application to your Azure Active Directory B2C tenant](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory-b2c/add-web-api-application?tabs=app-reg-ga).

[Configure scopes](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory-b2c/add-web-api-application?tabs=app-reg-ga#configure-scopes) paragraph explains how to create scopes for web application. Scopes can be considered as granular access levels. External applications can access protected Web API endpoints, only if the required scope (access level) is included in the access token, provided within the request to Web API. Once steps from this paragraph are completed `demo.read` and `demo.write` scopes are configured for Web API application. We will use these scopes to protect WebAPI endpoints in a second.

[Grant permissions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory-b2c/add-web-api-application?tabs=app-reg-ga#grant-permissions) paragraph shows how to grant blazor application permissions to `demo.read` and `demo.write` scopes. Once steps from this paragraph are completed, blazor application user's are able to obtain the authorization to Web API protected endpoints which require `demo.read` and `demo.write` scopes.

### Setting up demo application

Now, let's create Web API application. Again, we will use dotnet cli to pre-configure web api with Azure AD B2C settings. Fill the placeholders with your tenant and application data, before executing the command,

```
dotnet new webapi --auth IndividualB2C --aad-b2c-instance AAD-B2C-INSTANCE --domain DOMAIN --susi-policy-id SUSI-POLICY --client-id WEB-API-CLIENT-ID --default-scope demo.read 
```

|Command placeholder|Description|
|--- |--- |
|`AAD-B2C-INSTANCE`| Url to the Azure B2C instance - `https://TENANT_NAME.b2clogin.com/` |
|`DOMAIN`| Domain name can be found in Azure Portal in Azure AD B2C **Overview** blade|
|`SUSI-POLICY`|Name of the user flow used to log in/out users. Flow can be created in Azure AD B2C **User Flows** Blade. See [user flows documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory-b2c/tutorial-create-user-flows) for reference. Make sure entered user flow name is correct. Otherwise you can expect `Bearer error="invalid_token", error_description="The issuer '(null)' is invalid"` error later.|
|`CLIENT-ID`| Client id of blazor app registration can be found in corresponding app registration's **Overview** blade . Make sure client id belongs to the Web API app registration. Otherwise you can expect `Bearer error="invalid_token", error_description="The audience 'client_id'` error later.|

The dotnet cli command creates OAuth enabled Web API, pre-configured with your Azure AD B2C tenant settings. Web API contains single `/weatherforecast` endpoint, which requires `data.read` scope to be present in the access token (provided as an `Authorization` header within the endpoint request).

Before running Web API project, there are two required adjustments:

#### 1. CORS Policy

By default WebAPI server implements `same-origin` CORS policy. It means, Web API can only accept traffic from the domain it is hosted on. It prevents other (potentially malicious) applications from getting responses from Web API. To enable blazor application to get responses from Web API, policy must be loosened a little. Navigate to `Program.cs` and add following code.

```csharp
var  MyAllowSpecificOrigins = "_myAllowSpecificOrigins";
builder.Services.AddCors(options =>
{
    options.AddPolicy(name: MyAllowSpecificOrigins,
        policy  =>
        {
            policy.WithHeaders(["Authorization"]);
            policy.WithOrigins(["https://localhost:PORT"]); //replace PORT with the localhost port on which blazor app is running.
        });
});
//...
app.UseCors(MyAllowSpecificOrigins);
```

#### 2. Fix template generator bug

dotnet cli generator generated following line in `Program.cs` 

```csharp
var scopeRequiredByApi = app.Configuration["AzureAd:Scopes"] ?? "";
```

Replace it with

```csharp
var scopeRequiredByApi = app.Configuration["AzureAdB2C:Scopes"] ?? "";
```

it is required, since the `appSettings.json` section related with Azure AD B2C settings is named `AzureAdB2C`.

## Blazor application obtains authorization to the Web API

Now, let's focus on how to enable blazor application to obtain the access token from Azure AD B2C, and use it to request data from Web API `/weatherforecast` endpoint.

Blazor application created by dotnet cli command has the Weather tab already in place. 
![weather-tab](/assets/img/article14/weather-tab.png)

By default its content is filled with the static json data hosted within the blazor application.
![weather-data](/assets/img/article14/weather-data.png)

Blazor application uses `HttpClient`, to request the json data from its own domain

```csharp
//Program.cs
//...
builder.Services.AddScoped(sp => new HttpClient { BaseAddress = new Uri(builder.HostEnvironment.BaseAddress) });
```

### HttpClient that obtains access token

We need to replace the `HttpClient` registration with the `HttpClient` configured with Web API uri and able to obtain the authorization from Azure AD B2C. `HttpClient` class has a constructor which takes `HttpMessageHandler` as an argument. `HttpMessageHandler` is an abstract class containing `Send` and `SendAsync` methods. By implementing these, it is possible to add an extra logic before `HttpClient` sends the HTTP request. The extra logic can be used to obtain the access token from Azure AD B2C and attach it in the request's `Authorization` header.

Fortunately, we don't need to implement this logic by ourselves. ASP.NET Core contains `AuthorizationMessageHandler` class, which inherits from `HttpMessageHandler`, and provides an implementation, which obtains the access token from Azure AD B2C, and attaches it in the request's `Authorization` header.

`AuthorizationMessageHandler` can be initialized in the following way:

```csharp
//Program.cs
//...
builder.Services.AddScoped(sp => new HttpClient(sp.GetRequiredService<AuthorizationMessageHandler>()
.ConfigureHandler(
    authorizedUrls: new[] { "https://localhost:PORT/weatherforecast" },  //replace PORT with the localhost port on where Web API is running.
    scopes: new[] { "DEMO-READ-SCOPE" } // replace DEMO-READ-SCOPE with full scope name. 
))
{
    BaseAddress = new Uri("https://localhost:PORT/") //replace PORT with the localhost port on where Web API is running.
});
```

`AuthorizationMessageHandler` needs to be configured with

* authorizedUrls - urls which require authorization, access token will be attached to request to endpoints specified in this parameter
* scopes - the scope that is required, by the endpoints specified in authorizedUrls parameter. Before sending request to these endpoints, `AuthorizationMessageHandler` will try to obtain the access token with given scopes. Note that full scope name needs to be passed in this parameter. It can be copied from **Expose an API** blade in the Web API app registration.
![full-scope](/assets/img/article14/full-scope.png)

### In case of System.InvalidOperationException: The inner handler has not been assigned.

If the code causes `System.InvalidOperationException: The inner handler has not been assigned.` exception, it means the dotnet bug reported in https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/38486 is not fixed by the time you are reading this article :(. To fix the error, it is required to create a custom class, which inherits from `AuthorizationMessageHandler` and sets the inner handler. For instance:

```csharp
//WeatherMessageHandler.cs
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.WebAssembly.Authentication;

namespace BlazorWasm;

public class WeatherMessageHandler : AuthorizationMessageHandler
{
    public WeatherMessageHandler(IAccessTokenProvider provider, NavigationManager navigation) : base(provider, navigation)
    {
        ConfigureHandler(
            authorizedUrls: new[] { "https://localhost:7022/PORT" }, //replace PORT with the localhost port on where Web API is running.
            scopes: new[] { "DEMO-READ-SCOPE" } // replace DEMO-READ-SCOPE with full scope name. 
        InnerHandler = new HttpClientHandler(); //missing inner handler assignment
    }
}
```

Now `WeatherMessageHandler` can be used to instantiate `HttpClient` in `Program.cs`

```csharp
builder.Services.AddScoped(sp => new HttpClient(sp.GetRequiredService<WeatherMessageHandler>())
{
    BaseAddress = new Uri("https://localhost:7022/") //replace PORT with the localhost port on where Web API is running.
});
```

###  AuthorizationMessageHandler accesses API

As it was already mentioned Weather's page content is filled with the static json data hosted within the blazor application. Code below presents how `HttpClient` is used to request json data.

```csharp
// Pages/Weather.razor
@page "/weather"
@inject HttpClient Http
//...
protected override async Task OnInitializedAsync()
{
    forecasts = await Http.GetFromJsonAsync<WeatherForecast[]>("sample-data/weather.json");
}
//..
```

We have already changed the `HttpClient` registration, so injected `HttpClient` is now able to obtain the access token and attach it to HTTP request each time before it is sent to Web API.
Adjust above code the so it gets the data from proper Web API endpoint. Change `OnInitializedAsync` method as follows:

```csharp
try
{
    forecasts = await Http.GetFromJsonAsync<WeatherForecast[]>("weatherforecast");
}
catch (Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.WebAssembly.Authentication.AccessTokenNotAvailableException ex)
{ 
    ex.Redirect();
}
```

`AccessTokenNotAvailableException` is thrown when `HttpClient` is unable to obtain the access token. It can be caused by missing or expired user session. (If you are interested in user session topic I have already write an [article](https://melmanm.github.io/misc/2023/01/30/article3-openid-connect-session-management.html) covering this topc). When `AccessTokenNotAvailableException` is thrown, by calling `AccessTokenNotAvailableException.Redirect()` function, user is redirected to Azure AD B2C authorization endpoint for authentication.

## Testing

Run both Web API and blazor WSM applications and try to navigate to `Weather` tab.
